The `Aside` is a navigation layout that the sidebar can slide in and out of the
viewport. It is built in pure CSS.

By default, the Aside sidebar is collapsed whenever the window width is. But you
can add the off-canvas-sidebar-show class to the off-canvas to make the sidebar
expanded when the window width is larger than or equal to 960px.

The `Sidebar` is a navigation layout that the sidebar can slide in and out of
the viewport. It is built in pure CSS.

By default, the Sidebar is collapsed whenever the window width is. But you can
add the off-canvas-sidebar-show class to the off-canvas to make the sidebar
expanded when the window width is larger than or equal to 960px.

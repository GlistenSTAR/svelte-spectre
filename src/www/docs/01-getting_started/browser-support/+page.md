Spectre uses Autoprefixer to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers
and Normalize.css for CSS resets. Spectre is designed for modern browsers. For
best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

-   Chrome <Badge color="success">LAST 4</Badge>
-   Microsoft Edge <Badge color="success">LAST 4</Badge>
-   Firefox <Badge color="success">Extended Support Release</Badge>
-   Safari <Badge color="success">LAST 4</Badge>
-   Opera <Badge color="success">LAST 4</Badge>
-   Internet Explorer 10+

Spectre supports Internet Explorer 10+, but some HTML5 and CSS3 features are not
perfectly supported by Internet Explorer.
